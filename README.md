# Matching

Python implementations for the Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) using the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

## Usage

The program uses Click to produce the following command line interface. Execute with `python3 matching.py` [OPTIONS]

Options:

  -i, --input FILE:  Path to input json on which to run SMP algorithm. [required]

  -o, --output FILE:  Path to output file in which to print results.

  --help:  Show this message and exit.

If no output file is provided, the program simply prints to the command line.

## Algorithms

See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem> for the SMP problem. The Gale-Shapley algorithm for SMP runs in O(n^2) time for two groups of n. After execution, the program checks its solution to ensure correctness.

## Files

The program is split into logical chunks.

- `matching.py` is the highest level layer that interacts delegates computations.
- `read_validate.py` reads json input and ensures that input is valid.
- `marriage.py` contains the core of the Gale-Shapley algorithm.
- `write.py` writes solutions to the command line or an output file.

## Testing

All static testing material is contained in the `Test` directory. The script `generator.py` (run without arguments) uses `Test/female-names.txt` and `Test/male-names.txt` to generate valid json input for SMP, which it places in `Test/large_smp.json`. Note that `Test/small_smp.json` is also available as a more human-friendly test case.
